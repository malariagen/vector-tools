## Contamination
# Number of sites to consider for the contamination analysis
downsample: 50000

# minimum allele frequency of sites to consider for contamination analysis. (higher MAF SNPs are more informative).
minimum_af: 0.01

# minimum coverage to include a site in the contamination analysis.
minimum_coverage: 10

# which chromosomes/contigs to perform contamination analysis on.
seqid_contam: ["3L", "3R"]

# sequence error rate, required for contamination estimation algorithm
ser: 0.001

# sites at which samples have been genotyped
